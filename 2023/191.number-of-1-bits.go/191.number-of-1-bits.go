 *
 * Write a function that takesÂ the binary representation of an unsigned integer
 * and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming
 * weight).
 *
 * Note:
 *
 *
 * Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer
 * type. In this case, the input will be given as a signed integer type. It
 * should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary
 * representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.
 * In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using 2's complement
 * notation. Therefore, in Example 3, the input represents the signed integer.
 * -3.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: n = 00000000000000000000000000001011
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000000001011 has a
 * total of three '1' bits.
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: n = 00000000000000000000000010000000
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000010000000 has a
 * total of one '1' bit.
 *
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 *
 * Input: n = 11111111111111111111111111111101
 * Output: 31
 * Explanation: The input binary string 11111111111111111111111111111101 has a
 * total of thirty one '1' bits.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * The input must be a binary string of length 32.
 *
 *
 *
 * Follow up: If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?
