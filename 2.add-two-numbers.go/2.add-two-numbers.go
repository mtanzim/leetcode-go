 * Total Accepted:    3.2M
 * Total Submissions: 8M
 * Testcase Example:  '[2,4,3]\n[5,6,4]'
 *
 * You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative
 * integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes
 * contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sumÂ as a linked
 * list.
 *
 * You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the
 * number 0 itself.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
 * Output: [7,0,8]
 * Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
 * Output: [0]
 *
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 *
 * Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
 * Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range [1, 100].
 * 0 <= Node.val <= 9
 * It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have
 * leading zeros.
